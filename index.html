          <p>
            Chloe Chiu is an accomplished violinist and dedicated educator. Born
            in Taiwan, she made her solo concerto debut with an orchestra at the
            age of 11 and has since made her appearances in recitals, chamber
            music concerts across North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
            Currently, she is a member of several symphony orchestras including
            the Santa Barbara Symphony, Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and Long Beach
            Symphony. She also regularly collaborates with film composers and
            engages in diverse musical performances. Ms. Chiu received full
            scholarships to prestigious institutions, earning a Master of Music
            degree from Johns Hopkins University’s Peabody Institute and a
            Bachelor of Music degree from the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory in
            Singapore. She further refined her artistry through the Graduate
            Certificate Program at the University of Southern California. Her
            teachers include world- renowned violinists Victor Danchenko, former
            New York Phil concertmaster Glenn Dicterow, soloist Qian Zhou, and
            LA Philharmonic associate concertmaster Bing Wang. She also received
            chamber music training with the prestigious Tang quartet in
            Singapore, Paul Katz, and Karen Dreyfus at USC, where her string
            quartet was invited to perform at the Franco-American Music Festival
            in Missillac, France. As a violin instructor, Ms. Chiu is passionate
            about cultivating a supportive, structured, and inspiring learning
            environment. She emphasizes both technical excellence and musical
            expression, guiding her students to excel in auditions,
            competitions, and performances. Ms. Chiu’s instrument is generously
            sponsored by the Rin Collection in Singapore.
